This tutorial introduces you to the UNIX shell and both basic navigation and advanced uses such as statements and iterations.<br>

## Learning outcomes
* Interpret and implement absolute and relative paths in a UNIX hierarchy
* Recognise the various UNIX commands for navigation, creation, manipulation and viewing folders and files in UNIX
* Implement redirection and tab completion tasks
* Execute selection and interation commands in UNIX
* Recognise grep, sed and pipe command structures
* Appreciate the modification of the UNIX shell through profiles and aliases
* Install conda in a UNIX environment and create environments for installing packages

## Prerequisites
* It is recommended that you have [Notepad++ (Windows)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or [BBEdit (Mac)](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) for viewing fasta files; most linux default editors can do this.
* It is recommended that you have followed the [Concepts in Computer Programming](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/ConceptsInComputerProgramming) tutorial.

## Approximate time to finish tutorial
* UNIX basics worksheet: 3 hours (including installation and set up)
* Conda worksheet: 30 minutes
* UNIX advanced worksheet: 2 hours
* Pre/post surveys: 10 minutes

## Order of tutorial

Please do the pre-learning quiz, then do the worksheets. <br />
Once finished the tutorial, take the post-learing quiz.<br />

## Tutorials
### [UNIX shell tutorial (navigation, creation and viewing)](https://conmeehan.github.io/UNIXtutorial)
* A basic undertsanding of UNIX is needed if you wish to do the UNIX-based tasks in the rest of the workshop. I recommend to focus on understanding the contents of this tutorial first. 
### [Conda installation and use](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/Worksheets/CondaInstallAndUse)
* Conda is very useful for installing programmes used in the UNIX-based tasks in the rest of the workshop. I recommend following this tutorial before doing the others.
### [Advanced UNIX tutorial](https://conmeehan.github.io/advancedUNIXtutorial)
* The contents of this tutorial outline more advanced UNIX shell tasks (i.e. shell programming). A strong understanding of the contents of the first two tutorials is recommended before attempting this tutorial
  * Note that understanding this tutorials contents is niot necessary to follow the rest of the workshop, but is recommended if you wish to use UNIX extensively in the future.
