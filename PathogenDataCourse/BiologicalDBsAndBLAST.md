This tutorial outlines the various bio9logical online databases and their uses as well as an introduction to homology trminology and searching using BLAST.<br />

## Learning outcomes
* Identify online database types and retrieve data
* Describe types of homologs and gene evolution
* Recognise the types of BLAST and their uses
* Execute a BLAST search either via the terminal (BLAST+) or the NCBI website portal

## Prerequisites
* It is recommended that you have [Notepad++ (Windows)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or [BBEdit (Mac)](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) for viewing fasta files; most linux default editors can do this.
* It is recommended that you have followed the [Concepts in Computer Programming](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/ConceptsInComputerProgramming), [UNIX tutorial (basics)](https://conmeehan.github.io/UNIXtutorial) and [Setting up and using conda](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/CondaInstallAndUse) tutorials if you are going to do the BLAST+ worksheet.

## Order of tutorial

Please do the pre-learning quiz, then watch the presentation. <br />
During the presentation there are points to stop and do exercises, which are linked below. The answers to the questions in the exercises are linked within each one.<br />
Once finished the tutorial, take the post-learing quiz.<br />

## Presentation

## Tasks from slides with sample answers
### Motif searching 


## Worksheets
* [Using BLAST+ (UNIX environment) to search for homologous sequences](https://conmeehan.github.io/blast+tutorial)
* BLAST on the NCBI website
