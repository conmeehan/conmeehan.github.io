*	In this worksheet you will learn how to use Excel to make a bar chart or a column chart


## Suggested prerequisite(s)
*	An understanding of tidy data. See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1laBLEiw0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1laBLEiw0)

## Dataset
*	This demonstration uses [PairedDataset1.xlsx](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/Datasets/PairedDataset1.xslx)

## Steps
1.	Open the dataset in excel using File -> Open and selecting PairedDataset1.xlsx
    *	You can see for each Sample (names listed in column A) we have measurements at Baseline, Condition 1 and Condition 2
    *	Note how the data is tidy with conditions in the columns, samples in rows and each cell has a single value
2.	We wish to make a barchart with the samples (rows) on the x-axis, the values (cells) on the y-axis and a bar per condition (columns). 
3.	Select all the data by clicking on the first cell in the top right that contains ‘Sample name’ (i.e. cell A1)
4.	While holding down shift now select the bottom right cell (i.e. cell D11)
    *	This should now have all three columns and their sample names selected for comparison
5.	Click Insert from the top menu, then chart and then bar or column
    * Column is preferable as vertical lines are easier to read
6.	This should produce the chart in the middle of your sheet and automatically detect that the sample names are in column A. 
7.	We wish to store the chart in a different sheet so right click on a blank part of the chart and click ‘Move Chart’
8.	Click the button beside “New Sheet’ and give the chart a new name and click ok.
9.	Navigate to the new sheet you have created and you can see your chart there.
10.	Click on the chart and in the top left you should be able to click on ‘Add chart element’.
    *	Here you can add axis labels, remove the chart title (recommended) and change the positions of the labels (recommended to put to the right)
11.	Once happy with the chart you can save the new results using File -> Save
    *	You can also save the chart as an image by right clicking on the chart and selecting ‘Save as Picture’
