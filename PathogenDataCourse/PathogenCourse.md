This workshop contains a set of tutorials for undertaking basic data analytics for pathogen genomics research (although many topics covered are also applicable elsewhere).<br />
Each tutorial has a lecture or explanation of the topic with associated practice tasks and sample asnwers.<br />
It is suggested that you do these in order, or at least the concepts in computer programming, UNIX tutorials and R tutorial before the other topics. <br />
## Topics (each is a hyperlink to its own page):
### [Concepts in computer programming](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/ConceptsInComputerProgramming)
### [UNIX tutorial (basics)](https://conmeehan.github.io/UNIXtutorial)
### [UNIX shell tutorial (advanced)](https://conmeehan.github.io/advancedUNIXtutorial)
### [Setting up and using conda](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/CondaInstallAndUse)
