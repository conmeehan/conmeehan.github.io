This tutorial outlines the various online biological databases and their uses as well as an introduction to homology terminology and searching using BLAST.<br />

## Learning outcomes
* 


## Prerequisites
* It is recommended that you have [Notepad++ (Windows)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or [BBEdit (Mac)](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) for viewing fasta files; most linux default editors can do this.
* It is recommended that you have followed the [Concepts in Computer Programming](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/ConceptsInComputerProgramming), [UNIX tutorial (basics)](https://conmeehan.github.io/UNIXtutorial) and [Setting up and using conda](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/Worksheets/CondaInstallAndUse) tutorials if you are going to do the UNIX-based worksheets.

## Approximate time to finish tutorial
* Lecture:

* Pre/post surveys: 10 minutes


## Order of tutorial

Please do the pre-learning quiz, then watch the presentation. <br />
During the presentation there are points to stop and do exercises, which are linked below. The answers to the questions in the exercises are linked within each one.<br />
Once finished the tutorial, take the post-learing quiz.<br />
