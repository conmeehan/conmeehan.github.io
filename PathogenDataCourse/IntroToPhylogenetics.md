* This tutorial outlines the basics concepts in phylogenetics, including terminology and maximum likelihood approaches<br />

## Learning outcomes
* Identify the various sections of a phylogenetic tree
* Define various phylogenetic terminology
* Describe the process of parsimony tree building
* Translate a distance matrix into a phylogeny
* Discuss the drawbacks of non- and semi-parametric phylogenetic methods
* Calculate corrected distances using different models of evolution
* Explain a rate matrix
* Describe how site heterogeneity is modelled
* Define ascertainment bias and its effect on phylogenetics
* Describe the process of tree space searching
* Recognise the maximum likelihood and bootstrap approaches
* Use RAxML-NG to build a phylogenetic tree
* Visualise phylogenetic trees with either iTOL or R packages

## Prerequisites
* It is recommended that you have [Notepad++ (Windows)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or [BBEdit (Mac)](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) for viewing fasta files; most linux default editors can do this.
* It is recommended that you have followed the [Concepts in Computer Programming](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/ConceptsInComputerProgramming), [UNIX tutorial (basics)](https://conmeehan.github.io/UNIXtutorial) and [Setting up and using conda](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/CondaInstallAndUse) tutorials if you are going to do the RAxML-NG via terminal worksheet.
* It is recommended that you have followed the [Introduction to R](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/IntroToR) tutorial if you are going to do the visualising phylogenetic trees in R worksheet.

## Order of tutorial

Please do the pre-learning quiz, then watch the presentation. <br />
During the presentation there are points to stop and do exercises, which are linked below. The answers to the questions in the exercises are linked within each one.<br />
Once finished the tutorial, take the post-learing quiz.<br />
