* This tutorial outlines the basics concepts in Bayesian phylogenetics, and how it applies to molecular epidemiology (i.e. phylodynamics)<br />
Please note this is not an exhaustive tutorial on how to use Bayesian phylogenetics to build trees (as this would take too long). 

## Learning outcomes
* Recognise the Monte Carlo Markov Chain process
* Describe some common Bayesian epidemiology priors
* State the molecular clock hypothesis
* Describe the coalescent and its use for estimating population dynamics
* Identify the origins of a new pathogen using phylogenetics
* Recognise the approaches used to determine transmission dynamics of pathogens


## Prerequisites
* It is recommended that you have [Notepad++ (Windows)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or [BBEdit (Mac)](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) for viewing fasta files; most linux default editors can do this.
* It is recommended that you have followed the [Concepts in Computer Programming](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/ConceptsInComputerProgramming), [UNIX tutorial (basics)](https://conmeehan.github.io/UNIXtutorial) and [Setting up and using conda](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/CondaInstallAndUse) tutorials if you are going to do the RAxML-NG via terminal worksheet.
* It is recommended that you have followed the [Introduction to R](https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/IntroToR) tutorial if you are going to do the visualising phylogenetic trees in R worksheet.

## Order of tutorial

Please do the pre-learning quiz, then watch the presentation. <br />
During the presentation there are points to stop and do exercises, which are linked below. The answers to the questions in the exercises are linked within each one.<br />
Once finished the tutorial, take the post-learing quiz.<br />
