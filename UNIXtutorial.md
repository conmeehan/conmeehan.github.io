This tutorial outlines the basics needed for working with the UNIX environment. These are UNIX commands and thus they apply to Linux and Mac operating systems. Windows machines cannot run UNIX commands locally and will require additional software to do so (see below).


## Useful Material

A UNIX cheat sheet like [https://fosswire.com/post/2007/08/unixlinux-command-cheat-sheet this one] might be helpful as a reference.
