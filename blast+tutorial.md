##Expected learning outcomes

The objective of this lab is to get accustomed with performing BLAST searches from the command line. We will cover basic BLAST searching, modifying parameters, modifying output files, creating your own database, online searching and hit sequence extraction.

##BLAST+ overview

The command line (UNIX or Windows) version of BLAST is named BLAST+. You can download it from [here](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/) or install using [conda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/blast). The user manual for BLAST+ is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/) and contains instructions on installation of the command line tools, although I recommend using conda for this as it is easier to keep updated. This covers all of the functionality of BLAST+. Here, only a subset of features and basic usage will be covered.
